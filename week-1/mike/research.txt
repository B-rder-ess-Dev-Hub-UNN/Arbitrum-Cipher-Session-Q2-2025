What is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and how does it execute smart
 contracts?

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the core part of Ethereum’s blockchain
system. It acts like a global computer that anyone can use, but no 
person controls. The EVM is responsible for running smart contracts,
which are self-executing programs with rules written into their code.

A smart contract on Ethereum is made up of code that developers write, 
usually in a language like Solidity. When a smart contract is deployed, 
the EVM translates the high-level code into a lower-level form called 
"bytecode," which the EVM can understand and execute. This process ensures 
that smart contracts behave in the exact same way on every computer (or "node")
in the Ethereum network.

When someone interacts with a smart contract (for example, by sending 
a transaction), the EVM runs the contract’s code step-by-step. Each operation 
in the smart contract costs a small fee known as "gas," which prevents 
people from overloading the network with endless or heavy computations.
This system ensures that resources are used fairly and that smart contracts 
execute securely.

In short, the EVM acts like a secure, decentralized computer that can 
run programs exactly as written, without the need for trust between parties. 
It is a major reason why Ethereum can host decentralized applications (dApps) 
and manage digital agreements without a central authority.
