The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a decentralized virtual environment
 that executes code consistently and securely across all Ethereum nodes. 
 Nodes run the EVM to execute smart contracts, using "gas" to measure the computational effort required for operations,
  ensuring efficient resource allocation and network security.
   Ethereum is a distributed state machine(opens in a new tab).
    Ethereum's state is a large data structure which holds not only all accounts and balances,
     but a machine state, which can change from block to block according to a pre-defined set of rules, and which can execute arbitrary machine code. 
   The specific rules of changing state from block to block are defined by the EVM.
