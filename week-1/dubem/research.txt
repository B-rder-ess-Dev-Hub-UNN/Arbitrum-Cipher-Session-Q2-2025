What Is a Blockchain?

A Blockchain is a distributed, append-only, cryptographically linked data structure 
that stores a sequence of transactions or records in discrete containers called "Blocks". This means that
the blockchain network is a piece of technology that allows for transparency through its decentralized systam that spreads out information without any centarlized body determining its outcome.
The technology is ensured by its security integrity, where each block contains:
- A "hash" of the previous block (chaining them together)
- A list of "transactions" or records
- A timestamp
This chaining via hashes makes the ledger tamper-evident, where if you change the contents of any block, its hash changes,
 and that invalidates all the following blocks. This creates immutability. This technology ensures the legitimacy of online money, most notable Bitcoin.

Blockchains are typically decentralized — no single computer owns it. Instead:
- Every participant (called a node) stores a copy of the chain.
- New blocks are added through consensus algorithms — ways for the network to agree on the next valid block even if some nodes are malicious or faulty.
Examples include:
- Proof of Work (PoW) — used in Bitcoin
- Proof of Stake (PoS) —  used in Ethereum 

  Ethereum - The Ethereum Virtual Machine
Ethereum builds on the blockchain concept through:
Programmable Smart Contracts.
Unlike Bitcoin (which is mainly a ledger for payments), 
Ethereum adds a "Turing-complete virtual machine" called the "EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)" -
the EVM being a software that replicates the likeness of a computer.

This means:
- You can write codes called smart contracts, which are written in Solidty programming language
which would be copiled into bytecode for the EVM to be able to read its instructions and carry out the command given to it.
- Upload it to the blockchain
- And anyone can interact with it in a deterministic, decentralized way.
These smart contracts enable dApps —decentralized applications— which run exactly as programmed, without the risk of downtime or third-party interference.
Interaction with the blockchain through the EVM is aided through gas. Gas are fees paid to enable functioning of any interaction engaging on the network. 
This is done through Ether, the currency that fuels the Ethereum Network.
 Ether:
- It’s used to pay gas fees — costs required to execute transactions or run smart contracts
- These fees are paid to validators (formerly miners) who validate blocks and maintain the network’s integrity
- It creates an economic incentive structure to keep the system secure and fair
